"""Application state as reactive signals.

AppState provides centralized access to all application state via signals.
Panels read from these signals instead of polling the C++ runtime.

The C++ runtime updates these signals when state changes, pushing updates
to Python rather than requiring Python to poll.

Example:
    from lfs_plugins.ui import AppState

    # Read state
    if AppState.is_training.value:
        print(f"Iteration: {AppState.iteration.value}")

    # Subscribe to changes
    AppState.iteration.subscribe(lambda v: print(f"Now at {v}"))

        iteration: Current training iteration (C++ throttled)
        max_iterations: Maximum iterations target

        psnr: Current PSNR value
        num_gaussians: Current gaussian count (C++ throttled)

    Scene State:
        has_scene: Whether a scene is loaded
        scene_generation: Increments when scene changes (for cache invalidation)
